Tiny C Compiler Q3VM Edition - C Scripting for Q3VM 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Features:
--------

- SMALL! You can compile into Q3VM assembler. That's it.

- MAYBE FAST! tcc generates (hopefully) optimized Q3VM assembler.

- SAFE! tcc includes an optional memory and bound checker. Bound
  checked code can be mixed freely with standard code.

Documentation:
-------------

1) Installation on a i386/x86_64/arm Linux/OSX/FreeBSD host

   ./configure
   make
   make install

   Notes: OSX, FreeBSD or Windows are not a priority for me right now. I first have to get some understanding of the code before I can think about that.


2) Introduction

We assume here that you know ANSI C. Look at the example ex1.c to know
what the programs look like.

The include file <tcclib.h> can be used if you want a small basic libc
include support (especially useful for floppy disks). Of course, you
can also use standard headers, although they are slower to compile.

You can begin your C script with '#!/usr/local/bin/tcc -run' on the first
line and set its execute bits (chmod a+x your_script). Then, you can
launch the C code as a shell or perl script :-) The command line
arguments are put in 'argc' and 'argv' of the main functions, as in
ANSI C.

4) Full Documentation

Some things of tcc-doc.html still apply but most options will be gone. The documentation will look different in the end. t
